1. PROBLEM STATEMENT: I would like to create a action adventure game based on
dungeons & dragons where you can use a random number generator within a function
to simulate dice and allow a player to choose their own adventure through
the use of a number or text system. This program will allow the player to start
with an initial amount of hitpoints, and will allow the character to make a 
number of different choices more than one of which will allow them to beat the 
game. This game will allow for randomly generated combat which will either end
in the character dying and having to start over or defeating an enemy and 
continueing the adventure. The player will be prompted for what they want to do.
The player will be given a back story and setting and then will be asked what they
would like to do in that situation. 

Nouns:game, random number generator, dice, player, adventure, number system, 
text system, hitpoints, choices, randomly generated combat, defeating, enemy,
back story, setting, situation.

Verbs:create, simulate, choose, start, make choices, beat the game, dying, 
start over, defeating an enemy, continuing, prompted, given, asked

2. Defining Diagram

INPUTS: 
  characterName
  choice


PROCESSING:
  prompt for characterName
  display current hit points
  display back story
  display setting
  display choices
  prompt for choice
  display the next script based on choice
  loop through battle sequence
  display battle choices
  roll d20 to see if player hits enemy
  roll d8 if the player hits to do damage
  calculate the enemies new hitpoint status
  roll d20 for enemy to see if they hit character
  roll d6 to see how much damage the enemy does to the character
  calculate players new hitpoint status
  
  

OUTPUTS:
  display back story
  display setting
  display choices
  display new script based on choice
  display battle choices
  display player's hit points
  display player death
  display enemy death
  display ending script
  




3. Solution Algorithm
  RollD20()
    initialize result to 0
    convert result to number
    result = rand(1-20)
    return result    
  END

  RollD8()
    initialize result to 0
    convert result to number
    result = rand(1-8)
    return result    
  END

  RollD6()
    initialize result to 0
    convert result to number
    result = rand(1-6)
    return result    
  END
  
  Main
  
    initialize characterName = ""
    initialize characterHitPoints = 0
    initialize enemyHitPoints = 0
    initialize choice = 0
    
    prompt for characterName with "What is your character's name?"
    
    display starter back story
    display first choices
    
    prompt for choice
    
    diplay cooresponding text for the choice
    
    diplay next choice
    
    prompt for next decision
    
    Display "You have beaten the game!"
    
    or
    
    Display "You have died"
    prompt "Would you like to start over?"
    
  END
