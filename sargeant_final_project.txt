1. PROBLEM STATEMENT: I would like to create a action adventure game based on
dungeons & dragons where you can use a random number generator within a function
to simulate dice and allow a player to choose their own adventure through
the use of a number or text system. This program will allow the player to start
with an initial amount of hitpoints, and will allow the character to make a 
number of different choices more than one of which will allow them to beat the 
game. This game will allow for randomly generated combat which will either end
in the character dying and having to start over or defeating an enemy and 
continueing the adventure. The player will be prompted for what they want to do.
The player will be given a back story and setting and then will be asked what they
would like to do in that situation. 

Nouns:game, random number generator, dice, player, adventure, number system, 
text system, hitpoints, choices, randomly generated combat, defeating, enemy,
back story, setting, situation.

Verbs:create, simulate, choose, start, make choices, beat the game, dying, 
start over, defeating an enemy, continuing, prompted, given, asked

3. Solution Algorithm
  RollD20()
    initialize result to 0
    convert result to number
    result = rand(1-20)
    return result    
  END

  RollD8()
    initialize result to 0
    convert result to number
    result = rand(1-8)
    return result    
  END

  RollD6()
    initialize result to 0
    convert result to number
    result = rand(1-6)
    return result    
  END
  
  Main
  
    Initialize characterHitPoints = 8
    Initialize enemyHitPoints = 8
    Initialize saveVSSpell = 10
    Initialize armorClass = 8
    Initialize damage = 4
    
    Display image as link to main function/html page
    Display starter back story
    Display first choices
    
    Prompt for choice
    
    Display character stats such as hitpoint, armorClass, saveVSSpell, and damage
    Diplay cooresponding text for the choice
    Display cooresponding picture for the choice
    
    Diplay next choices
    
    prompt for next decision
    
    Display ending text, picture, and start over link
    
    or
    
    Display "You have died"
    Display text, picture, and start over link
    
  END
